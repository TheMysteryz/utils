# utils

This is my helper functions and utilities library. It is a collection of functions that I use in my projects. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more functions as I need them.

It's published as an npm package and can be installed using the following command:

```bash
npx jsr add @pifplif/utils
# or via Bun
bunx jsr add @pifplif/utils
```

Visit the [jsr page](https://jsr.io/@pifplif/utils) for more information.

> This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.20. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
